#' # Introduction #
#' 

#' # Reflexivity #
#' *Before starting the lab, spend 5 minutes writing a response to each reflexivity question.  Use a timer.  Answer these questions off the top of your head: don't worry about consulting or citing outside sources or about getting the answers "right" or "wrong."* 
#' 1. *What do I already know about this subject?*
#' 2. *Why am I studying this?*
#' 3. *What do I expect or hope to find/learn, and why?*
#' 4. *Who is affected by this topic, and how am I connected to them?* 
#' 

#' # Setup #
#' **IMPORTANT**: Add all dependencies to `DESCRIPTION`

## To check your answers locally, run the following: 
## testthat::test_dir('tests')

#' # Problem 1 #
#' *Assign the value `2L` to `foo`.* 
foo = 2L
